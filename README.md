# Crystal Collector Game

Crystal Collector is a game designed to give the user 4 different crystals (each with randomly generated numbers associated to them) to click on in order to add the crystals value to an accumulating score.  There is a large target score to reach and if the user is able to match the target score with their accumulated score then the user wins.  If the user goes over the target score with their accumulated score then the user loses.
